This is a solution for the coding problem [844. Backspace String Compare from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/backspace-string-compare/description):

Have you ever used a text editor or a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs? Sometimes you may make a mistake while typing and want to delete a character or a whole word. In these programs, you can use the backspace key on your keyboard to delete characters from the text.

But what if you want to delete a character in a string in a programming language like Python? One way to do this is to use a special character called a "backspace" character, which is written as '#'.

Let's say you have two strings, `s` and `t`, and you want to compare them to see if they are the same. But these strings might contain backspace characters, which means you need to delete some characters before you can compare the strings.

To solve this problem, we can write a function called `backspaceCompare` that takes in two strings, `s` and `t`, and returns `True` if the strings are equal after the backspace characters have been applied.

Here's how the function works:

1.  First, we define a helper function called `get_final_string` that takes in a string and applies the backspace operation to it.
2.  Inside the `get_final_string` function, we create an empty list called `stack`. This list will be used to store the characters that we want to keep after applying the backspace operation.
3.  We iterate over the characters in the string.
4.  If the character is a backspace character ('#'), we check if the `stack` list is empty. If it is not empty, we pop the last character from the `stack` list. This simulates the backspace operation by deleting the last character in the list.
5.  If the character is not a backspace character, we add it to the `stack` list.
6.  After we have iterated over all the characters in the string, we join the characters in the `stack` list and return the resulting string.
7.  Finally, in the `backspaceCompare` function, we call the `get_final_string` function on both `s` and `t`, and compare the resulting strings. If they are equal, we return `True`, otherwise we return `False`.

Let's test the `backspaceCompare` function with some examples:

```python
print(backspaceCompare("ab#c", "ad#c"))  # should print True
print(backspaceCompare("ab##", "c#d#"))  # should print True
print(backspaceCompare("a#c", "b"))  # should print False

```

In the first example, we compare the strings "ab#c" and "ad#c". After applying the backspace operation, both strings become "ac", so the function should return `True`.

In the second example, we compare the strings "ab##" and "c#d#". After applying the backspace operation, both strings become empty, so the function should return `True`.

In the third example, we compare the strings "a#c" and "b". After applying the backspace operation, the first string becomes "c" and the second string becomes "b". Since these strings are not equal, the function should return `False`.

And that's it! We have successfully implemented a function to compare two strings with backspace characters.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the `backspaceCompare` function is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string between `s` and `t`. This is because we iterate over both strings once to apply the backspace operation.

The space complexity of the function is also O(n), as we store all the characters of both strings in the `stack` list while applying the backspace operation. This is because we need to store the characters temporarily in order to apply the backspace operation.

Note that the space complexity could be improved to O(1) if we didn't use a list to store the characters, but rather applied the backspace operation directly to the original string. However, this would require more complex code and would not change the overall time complexity of the function.
