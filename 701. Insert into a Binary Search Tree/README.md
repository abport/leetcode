This is a solution for the coding problem [701. Insert into a Binary Search Tree from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/description):

### Explanation:

We are going to learn about how to insert a new value into a binary search tree (BST).

A binary search tree is a special type of tree where the values of the nodes are ordered in a specific way. Each node in the tree has a value, and the values of all the nodes in the left subtree of a node are smaller than the value of the node, while the values of all the nodes in the right subtree are larger.

To insert a new value into a BST, we start at the root node and compare the value we want to insert with the value of the current node. If the value we want to insert is smaller than the current node's value, we move to the left child. If the value we want to insert is larger, we move to the right child. We keep doing this until we reach a node that doesn't have a left or right child, and then we insert the new value as the left or right child, respectively.

Here is an example of how we can do this in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def insertIntoBST(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:
    if not root:
        # If the root is None, return a new TreeNode with the given value
        return TreeNode(val)
    if val < root.val:
        # If the value to insert is smaller than the current node's value,
        # recursively call the function on the left child
        root.left = self.insertIntoBST(root.left, val)
    else:
        # If the value to insert is larger than the current node's value,
        # recursively call the function on the right child
        root.right = self.insertIntoBST(root.right, val)
    return root
```

This function takes in a `TreeNode` object representing the root of the BST and an integer value to insert into the tree. It returns the root of the BST after the insertion.

Now, let's talk about the time and space complexity of this algorithm.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(h), where h is the height of the BST. This means that the time it takes to insert a new value into the BST depends on how deep the tree is. The deeper the tree, the longer it will take to insert a new value.

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(h), because we need to store the recursive function calls in the call stack.

I hope this helps you understand how to insert a new value into a BST. Happy coding!
