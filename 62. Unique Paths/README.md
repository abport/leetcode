This is solution for the coding problem [62. Unique Paths from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/description):

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming.

We can create a 2D array `dp` of size `m x n`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of unique paths from the top-left corner (`grid[0][0]`) to the cell `grid[i][j]`.

Then, we can initialize the first row and the first column of the `dp` array with 1, because there is only one way to reach the cells in the first row and the first column (by moving right or down, respectively).

For the rest of the cells, we can compute the number of unique paths by adding the number of paths from the cell on the top with the number of paths from the cell on the left. This is because the robot can either move down or right to reach a cell.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    # create the dp array and initialize the first row and column with 1
    dp = [[1] * n for _ in range(m)]

    # fill the dp array
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

    # return the number of unique paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

The time complexity of the above solution is O(m\*n), because we need to fill the entire `dp` array of size `m x n`.

The space complexity is also O(m\*n), because we need to store the values in the `dp` array.
