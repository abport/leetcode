This is a solution for the coding problem [1. Two Sum from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description):

- The first line defines a class called `Solution` that has a method called `twoSum`.
- The next line is a docstring, which is a special kind of comment that explains what the method does. It says that the method takes in a list of integers called `nums` and an integer called `target`, and returns a list of integers.
- The next line creates a new empty dictionary called `hashMap`. This will be used to store the values that we've seen so far and their indices.
- The next line starts a loop that will iterate over all the elements in the `nums` list. For each element, the loop will do the following:

1.  Calculate the difference between the `target` and the current element. This difference is the value that we need to find in order to add up to the target.
2.  Check if the difference is already in the `hashMap` dictionary. If it is, that means we've already seen a number that, when added to the current number, will add up to the target. In this case, we return a list with the indices of these two numbers.
3.  If the difference is not in the `hashMap`, we add the current number and its index to the `hashMap`.

- If the loop finishes running and we haven't found a solution, we return an empty list.

The time complexity of the `twoSum` method is O(n), because it loops through all the elements in the `nums` list once.

The space complexity is also O(n), because the size of the `hashMap` dictionary grows as the number of elements in the `nums` list grows.

Therefore, the overall time and space complexity of the `twoSum` method is O(n). This means that the method will take longer to run and use more memory as the size of the input increases. However, the time and space complexity are both linear, which is generally considered to be very efficient.
