```python
    heap = [-num for num in piles]  # This creates a new list called heap which contains the negative values of each element in the piles list
    # So if the piles list is [5, 4, 9], the heap list will be [-5, -4, -9]

    heapq.heapify(heap)  # This rearranges the elements in the heap list so that they follow the rules of a heap data structure
    # A heap is a tree-like data structure where the parent nodes are either greater than or less than their child nodes (depending on the type of heap)
    # In this case, we are using a "min heap", which means that the parent nodes are always less than their child nodes

    for _ in range(k):  # This starts a loop that will run for k number of times
        curr = -heapq.heappop(heap)  # This removes and returns the smallest element from the heap (which is the first element in the list since the list is now a heap)
        # The heappop function also rearranges the remaining elements in the list so that they continue to follow the rules of a heap
        # The smallest element is then negated and stored in a variable called curr
        # For example, if k is 2 and the heap list is [-5, -4, -9], the first time through the loop curr would be 9

        remove = curr // 2  # This calculates the value of remove by dividing curr by 2 and using the "//" operator to round the result down to the nearest integer
        # For example, if curr is 9, remove would be 4

        heapq.heappush(heap, -(curr - remove))  # This adds a new element to the heap
        # The new element is the negative of the value of curr minus remove
        # For example, if curr is 9 and remove is 4, the new element would be -(9 - 4) which is -5
        # The heappush function also rearranges the elements in the list so that they continue to follow the rules of a heap

    return -sum(heap)  # This returns the negative sum of all the elements in the heap
    # It does this by using the sum function to add up all the elements in the heap and then negating the result

```

The time complexity of this code is O(n_k_log(n)), where n is the number of elements in the "piles" list and k is the number of times the loop runs. This is because the "heapq.heapify" function has a time complexity of O(n) and the "heapq.heappop" and "heapq.heappush" functions both have a time complexity of O(log(n)). The loop runs for k iterations, so the overall time complexity is O(n_k_log(n)).

The space complexity of this code is O(n), since it uses a list of size n to store the heap.
