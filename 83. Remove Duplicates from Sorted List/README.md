This is a solution for the Coding Problem [83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/description):

The problem wants us to remove all duplicate elements from a sorted linked list, such that each element appears only once. A linked list is a data structure that consists of a series of nodes, where each node stores a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in a linked list is called the head.

To solve this problem, we can use a while loop to iterate through the linked list. For each node in the linked list, we check if the next node exists and if it has the same value as the current node. If the next node exists and has the same value as the current node, we skip over the next node by setting the current node's `next` pointer to the node after the next node. This effectively removes the next node from the linked list. If the next node does not have the same value as the current node, we move on to the next node by setting the current node to the next node.

Once we have removed all duplicates, we return the head of the linked list. This will be the sorted linked list with all duplicates removed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
