This is a solution for the Coding Problem [617. Merge Two Binary Trees from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-binary-trees/description):

Imagine that you have two trees, and each tree has a bunch of branches and leaves. The branches can have other branches coming off of them, and those branches can have even more branches coming off of them, and so on.

The problem wants us to take these two trees and combine them into a new tree, where if two branches or leaves have the same place in the tree (for example, if they're both the left branch of the same parent branch), we add their values together and use the sum as the value for the new branch. If one tree doesn't have a branch or leaf in a certain place, we just use the branch or leaf from the other tree.

To solve this problem, we can start at the top of both trees (the roots) and compare them. If both trees have a root, we add their values together and create a new root with that sum. Then, we can move on to the left branches of both trees and do the same thing, adding their values together and creating a new branch with the sum. We can also do the same thing with the right branches. We keep doing this until we've looked at all the branches and leaves in both trees.

This is called a depth-first search, because we start at the top and go all the way down to the bottom of the tree before moving on to the next branch. This helps us make sure that we're combining all the branches and leaves in the right order.

Here's an explanation of the code, line by line:

    class Solution:
        def mergeTrees(self, root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:

This code defines a class called `Solution` and a function called `mergeTrees` inside of it. The function takes two inputs: `root1` and `root2`, which are the roots of the two trees we want to merge. The function returns a new tree that is the result of merging `root1` and `root2`.

    if not root1:
                return root2
            if not root2:
                return root1

These lines of code check if either `root1` or `root2` is `None`, which means that one of the trees is empty. If either of them is `None`, the function returns the other tree as the result of the merge. This is because if one of the trees is empty, there's nothing to merge, so we just return the other tree.

    root = TreeNode(root1.val + root2.val)

This line creates a new `TreeNode` called `root` with a value that is the sum of the values of `root1` and `root2`.

    root.left = self.mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left)
            root.right = self.mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right)

These lines recursively call the `mergeTrees` function on the left branches of both trees and the right branches of both trees. The result of these calls is used to set the left and right branches of the new `root` node.

    return root

Finally, this line returns the new `root` node, which is the result of the merge.
