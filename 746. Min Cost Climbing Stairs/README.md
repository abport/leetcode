This is solution for the coding problem [746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description):

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming.

Dynamic programming is a technique for solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing the solutions to subproblems in an array so that they can be reused (by avoiding calculating the answer for the same subproblem multiple times).

Here's the solution in Python:

```python
def minCostClimbingStairs(cost):
    n = len(cost)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2])
    return dp[n]
```

Let's break down the solution:

1.  We first initialize an array `dp` of size `n + 1` with all elements set to 0. This array will store the minimum cost to reach each step.
2.  We loop through the array from index 2 to `n + 1` (since we can either start from index 0 or 1).
3.  For each iteration, we calculate the minimum cost to reach the current step by taking the minimum of the cost to reach the previous step plus the cost of the current step, and the cost to reach the step before that plus the cost of the step before that.
4.  We store the minimum cost in the `dp` array at the current index.
5.  Finally, we return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor, which is stored at index `n` in the `dp` array.

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), since we loop through the array once and perform constant time operations inside the loop.

The space complexity is also O(n), since we create an array of size `n+1` to store the minimum cost to reach each step.

So the solution is efficient both in terms of time and space.
