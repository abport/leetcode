This is a solution for the coding problem [692. Top K Frequent Words from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/description?envType=study-plan&id=level-1):

In this article, we are going to learn how to find the most frequent words in a list of words. This is a common problem that we might encounter when working with text data. For example, we might want to find the most common words used in a book or the most used hashtags on Twitter.

To solve this problem, we can use a special data structure called a "heap". A heap is a tree-like data structure that allows us to efficiently find the smallest or largest element. In this case, we will use a min heap to store the words sorted by their frequency and lexicographical order.

First, we need to count the frequency of each word in the list. We can use a dictionary to do this. A dictionary is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. In this case, the keys are the words and the values are their frequencies.

Next, we create a min heap to store the words sorted by their frequency and lexicographical order. We can do this by iterating through the dictionary and adding each word and its frequency as a tuple to the heap.

Finally, we pop the first `k` elements from the heap and return them as the result. The first `k` elements will be the words with the highest frequency, sorted by lexicographical order.

Here is the code to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def topKFrequent(words, k):
    # Count the frequency of each word
    word_count = Counter(words)

    # Create a min heap to store the words sorted by their frequency and lexicographical order
    heap = [(-count, word) for word, count in word_count.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    # Pop the first k elements from the heap and return them
    return [heapq.heappop(heap)[1] for _ in range(k)]
```

Let's see an example of how we can use this function:

```python
words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"]
k = 2
print(topKFrequent(words, k)) # should print ["i", "love"]

words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"]
k = 4
print(topKFrequent(words, k)) # should print ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n_log(n)), where n is the number of words in the list. This is because we need to iterate through the list to count the frequency of each word and we also need to build the heap, which has a time complexity of O(n_log(n)).

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), because we need to store all the words and their frequencies in the heap.

I hope you understood how to solve this problem using a heap. Heaps are a very useful data structure and you will see them again in other problems.
