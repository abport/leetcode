This is a solution for the Coding Problem [116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node/description):

The problem wants us to fill in the "next" pointers for each node in a special kind of tree called a perfect binary tree. A perfect binary tree is a tree where all the leaf nodes (nodes without any children) are on the same level, and every parent node has exactly two children.

The "next" pointer for each node is supposed to point to the next node on the same level, to the right of the current node. If there is no next node on the same level, the "next" pointer should be set to `NULL`.

To solve this problem, we came up with an algorithm that goes through the tree level by level, from left to right. For each node, we set its "next" pointer to point to the next node on the same level. We do this by using a special data structure called a queue, which helps us keep track of the nodes at each level as we go through the tree.

We start by putting the root node (the topmost node in the tree) into the queue. Then, we keep going through the tree level by level, until the queue is empty. For each level, we go through all the nodes and set their "next" pointers to point to the next node on the same level. We also add the left and right children of each node to the queue, so that we can visit them in the next iteration.

By following this algorithm, we are able to fill in all the "next" pointers in the tree, and the problem is solved!

The time complexity of the solution code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This means that the running time of the code is directly proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.

The reason for this is that we visit each node in the tree exactly once, and we do a constant amount of work for each node (we set its "next" pointer and add its children to the queue). Since the number of nodes is the main factor that determines how much work needs to be done, the running time is directly proportional to the number of nodes.

The space complexity of the solution code is also O(n). This means that the amount of memory used by the code is directly proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.

The reason for this is that we use a queue to store the nodes at each level as we go through the tree. The size of the queue can be as large as the number of nodes in the tree (if all the nodes are on the same level), so the space complexity is also directly proportional to the number of nodes.

Here is an explanation of the code line by line:

    def connect(root):
        # check if the root node is None
        if not root:
            # if it is, return immediately
            return

This first part of the code checks if the root node (the topmost node in the tree) is `None`. If it is, it means that the tree is empty and there is nothing to do, so we return immediately.

    # initialize a queue with the root node
        queue = [root]

Next, we initialize a queue with the root node. A queue is a special data structure that allows us to store a list of items in a specific order. In this case, we will use the queue to keep track of the nodes at each level as we go through the tree.

    # traverse the tree level by level
        while queue:
            # get the size of the current level
            size = len(queue)

We start a `while` loop that will keep going until the queue is empty. Inside the loop, we get the size of the current level by checking the length of the queue. This will tell us how many nodes are on the current level.

    # iterate over all the nodes on the current level
            for i in range(size):
                # get the next node
                node = queue.pop(0)

Next, we start a `for` loop that will iterate over all the nodes on the current level. For each node, we get the next node from the front of the queue and store it in a variable called `node`.

    # set the next pointer of the current node
                if i < size - 1:
                    node.next = queue[0]

Inside the `for` loop, we check if the current node is not the last node on the current level. If it is not, we set the "next" pointer of the current node to point to the next node on the same level (which is at the front of the queue).

    # add the left and right children to the queue
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)

Finally, we check if the current node has a left and right child. If it does, we add them to the end of the queue. This will ensure that we visit them in the next iteration of the `while` loop.

    return root

After we have finished going through the tree, we return the root node.
