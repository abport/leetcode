This is solution for the coding problem [790. Domino and Tromino Tiling from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/description):

The code uses dynamic programming to solve the problem of tiling a 2 x n board using 2 x 1 domino tiles and tromino tiles.

The algorithm starts by initializing an array `dp` with the values `[0, 1, 2, 5]`. The values `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 2` represent the number of ways to tile a 2 x 1 board and a 2 x 2 board, respectively. The value `dp[3] = 5` represents the number of ways to tile a 2 x 3 board, which can be computed as follows:

- 1 way to tile the board using 3 tromino tiles
- 1 way to tile the board using 2 tromino tiles and 1 domino tile
- 1 way to tile the board using 1 tromino tile and 2 domino tiles
- 2 ways to tile the board using 3 domino tiles

Then, the algorithm iterates from `i = 4` to `n`, and for each `i`, it computes `dp[i]` as the sum of the number of ways to tile a 2 x (i - 1) board using tromino tiles and the number of ways to tile a 2 x (i - 3) board using tromino tiles. This is done by the following line of code:

```python
dp[i] = 2 * dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 3]
```

Finally, the algorithm returns `dp[n] % kMod`, where `kMod` is a constant equal to 1,000,000,007. This is done to reduce the size of the result, since the problem states that the answer may be very large and should be returned modulo 1,000,000,007.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), since it iterates through all values of `i` from 4 to `n`. The space complexity is O(n), since it uses an array of size `n` to store the intermediate results.
