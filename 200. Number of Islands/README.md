This is a solution for the Coding Problem [200. Number of Islands from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description):

Imagine you have a map of a group of islands and some water surrounding them. Your task is to count how many islands there are on the map.

To do this, we can use a special way of exploring the map called a "depth-first search". This means that we start at a particular island and then explore all of the islands that are connected to it, marking them as we go. This will allow us to find all the cells that are part of a single island.

We can start by looping through each cell on the map. If we find a cell that is an island ('1'), we can mark it as visited and then perform a depth-first search on its neighbors to find all the cells that are connected to it. This will allow us to identify a single island.

Then, we can repeat this process until we have explored the entire map, counting the number of islands that we find.

For example, let's say we have the following map:

    [  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","1","0"],
      ["1","1","0","0","0"],
      ["0","0","0","0","0"]
    ]

We can start by looking at the cell in the top left corner. Since it is an island ('1'), we can mark it as visited and then explore its neighbors. We find that all of its neighbors are also islands, so we mark them as visited as well.

We continue this process until we have explored all of the cells that are connected to the starting cell. Once we are done, we have found a single island. We can then move on to the next unvisited cell and repeat the process until we have explored the entire map.

In this example, we only find one island. However, if we had more islands on the map, we would continue the process until we had explored the entire map and counted all of the islands.

Here is an explanation of each line of the code:

    def numIslands(grid):
        if not grid:
            return 0

The first line defines a function called `numIslands` that takes in a variable called `grid`. The second line is an `if` statement that checks if the `grid` is empty. If it is, the function returns `0`. This is a simple check to make sure that we have a valid input.

    rows = len(grid)
        cols = len(grid[0])
        count = 0

The next three lines are defining some variables. `rows` is the number of rows in the `grid`, `cols` is the number of columns in the `grid`, and `count` is a variable that will keep track of the number of islands we find.

    def dfs(i, j):
            if i < 0 or i >= rows or j < 0 or j >= cols or grid[i][j] != '1':
                return
            grid[i][j] = '#'
            dfs(i-1, j)
            dfs(i+1, j)
            dfs(i, j-1)
            dfs(i, j+1)

This block of code defines a function called `dfs` that takes in two variables, `i` and `j`. This function will be used to perform a depth-first search on the `grid`.

The `if` statement at the beginning of the function checks if the current cell is out of bounds or is not an island ('1'). If either of these conditions is true, the function returns without doing anything.

If the current cell is a valid island, the function marks it as visited by changing the value to '#'. Then, it calls itself on the cell to the left, the cell to the right, the cell above, and the cell below. This will allow the function to explore all of the cells that are connected to the current cell.

    for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    dfs(i, j)
                    count += 1

The next block of code is a double `for` loop that will iterate over every cell in the `grid`. If a cell is an island ('1'), it calls the `dfs` function on that cell and then increments the `count` variable by `1`. This will allow us to find all of the islands on the map and keep track of how many we find.

    return count

Finally, the function returns the `count` variable, which is the number of islands that were found.
