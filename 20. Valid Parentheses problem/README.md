This is a solution for the Coding Problem [20.  Valid Parentheses from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/description):



To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the open brackets as we iterate through the string.

For each character in the string, we do the following:

-   If the character is an open bracket (i.e., `'('`, `'['`, or `'{'`), we push it onto the stack.
-   If the character is a close bracket (i.e., `')'`, `']'`, or `'}'`), we pop the top element from the stack and check that it is the corresponding open bracket. If it is not, then the input string is not valid.

If we finish iterating through the string and the stack is empty, then the input string is valid. Otherwise, it is not valid.

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we iterate through the string once and perform a constant number of operations on each iteration.

The space complexity is also O(n), because the size of the stack can grow up to n elements if all characters in the string are open brackets.

In general, the space complexity of this solution is optimal because we can't do better than O(n) in the worst case. 
However, the time complexity can potentially be improved by using a different data structure for the stack, such as a linked list, which would allow us to pop elements in constant time. However, using a list (as in the above solution) is simpler and is sufficient for most cases.
