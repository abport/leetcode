This is a solution for the Coding Problem [206. Reverse Linked List from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/description):

This code is to reverse a list of items. The items are connected to each other in a certain order, like a chain. Each item is called a "node", and it has a value (like a number or a letter) and a link to the next item in the list.

The first part of the code defines a "ListNode" class. This is like a blueprint for creating nodes. When we make a new node, we can give it a value and a link to the next node.

The second part of the code is a class called "Solution". This class has a special function called "reverseList" that takes in a list (called "head") and returns the same list, but in reverse order.

The function starts by checking if the list is empty. If it is, it just returns the list as it is (since there's nothing to reverse).

If the list is not empty, the function sets up two variables: "prev_node" and "curr_node". "prev_node" is for keeping track of the node we just visited, and "curr_node" is for the current node we're looking at.

The function then starts a loop that will keep going until we reach the end of the list. Inside the loop, the function saves the next node in the list in a variable called "next_node". This is so we don't lose track of where we were going next.

Then, the function reverses the link between the current node and the next node by changing the "next" pointer of the current node to point to the previous node instead. This is what actually reverses the list.

After that, the function updates the previous node to be the current node, and the current node to be the next node. This moves us forward in the list.

Finally, when we reach the end of the list and the loop stops, the function returns the previous node. This is the first node in the reversed list.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
