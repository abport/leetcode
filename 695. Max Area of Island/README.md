This is a solution for the Coding Problem [695. Max Area of Island from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-area-of-island/description):

The problem wants us to find the biggest island in a grid of numbers. An island is a group of 1's (land) that are connected to each other either vertically or horizontally.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called depth-first search (DFS). This means that we will start at one cell of the grid and explore all the cells that are connected to it, marking them as visited. If we find another cell with value 1, we will start exploring it as well. This way, we can visit all the cells in an island and count how many cells are there.

We can do this for every cell in the grid and keep track of the biggest island we have found so far. This way, we can find the biggest island in the grid.

Here is an explanation of the code line by line:

    def maxAreaOfIsland(grid):

This line defines a function called `maxAreaOfIsland` that takes a single argument `grid`, which is a two-dimensional array of numbers representing the grid.

    # Function to perform DFS from a given cell
        def dfs(i, j):

This line defines a function called `dfs` that takes two arguments: `i` and `j`. These arguments represent the row and column indices of a cell in the grid, respectively. The `dfs` function will be used to explore an island starting from the cell at position `(i, j)`.

    # Check if the cell is within the grid bounds and has value 1
            if 0 <= i < len(grid) and 0 <= j < len(grid[0]) and grid[i][j] == 1:

This line checks if the cell at position `(i, j)` is within the bounds of the grid (i.e., it has a valid row and column index) and has value 1. If both conditions are true, it means that the cell is part of an island and we can explore it.

    # Mark the cell as visited by setting its value to 0
                grid[i][j] = 0

This line marks the cell as visited by setting its value to 0. This is important to prevent us from exploring the same cell multiple times.

    # Explore the neighbors of the cell
                return 1 + dfs(i+1, j) + dfs(i-1, j) + dfs(i, j+1) + dfs(i, j-1)

This line explores the neighbors of the cell at position `(i, j)`. It does this by calling the `dfs` function recursively on the cells to the right, left, top, and bottom of the current cell. The `return` statement at the end of this line returns the number of cells in the island, including the current cell.

    return 0

If the cell at position `(i, j)` is not within the bounds of the grid or does not have value 1, this line is executed and the function returns 0, which means that the cell is not part of an island.

    # Initialize the maximum area to 0
        max_area = 0

This line initializes a variable called `max_area` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the maximum area of an island we have found so far.

    # Iterate through each cell in the grid
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):

This `for` loop iterates through each cell in the grid by using two nested `for` loops. The outer loop iterates through the rows of the grid and the inner loop iterates through the columns of the grid.

    # If the cell has value 1, start a DFS from it and update the maximum area
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    max_area = max(max_area, dfs(i, j))

This line checks if the cell at position `(i, j)` has value 1. If it does, it starts a depth-first search from that cell by calling the `dfs` function and passing it the row and column indices of the cell as arguments. The `dfs` function will then explore the island starting from that cell and return the number of cells in the island.

The `max` function is used to update the value of `max_area` with the maximum of its current value and the number of cells in the island. This way, we can keep track of the maximum area we have found so far.

    return max_area

Finally, this line returns the value of `max_area`, which is the maximum area of an island in the grid.
