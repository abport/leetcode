This is a solution for the Coding Problem [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description):

we have two lists that are already sorted in ascending order. Our job is to merge these two lists into one single list that is also sorted in ascending order.

We start by checking if either of the lists is empty. If one of them is empty, we can just return the other list because it will already be sorted.

Then, we create a new linked list called `merged_list` to store the result. We also create a `current` variable that will help us keep track of the current position in the `merged_list`.

Next, we have a `while` loop that will run as long as both `list1` and `list2` have elements. Inside the loop, we compare the values of the first element in each list. Whichever value is smaller, we add it to the `merged_list` and move to the next element in that list. If the values are the same, we can add either one to the `merged_list`.

Finally, after the `while` loop is done, we might still have some elements left in either `list1` or `list2`. So we add the remaining elements to the `merged_list`.

And that's it! We now have a single sorted list containing all the elements from both `list1` and `list2`.
