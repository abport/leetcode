This is a solution for the coding problem [134. Gas Station from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/description) in Python:

Do you like going on road trips? Have you ever been on a long road trip and had to stop at a gas station to fill up your car's tank? Well, today we're going to talk about a problem that involves gas stations, too!

The "**Gas Station**" problem is all about figuring out whether it's possible to drive around a circular route and stop at all the gas stations along the way, without running out of gas. Sounds fun, right?

Here's how the problem works: imagine you are driving around a circle and there are N gas stations along the way. At each gas station, you can either fill up your gas tank or not. You have a list of how much gas you can get at each station, and another list of how much gas it will cost you to get to the next station.

Your task is to figure out whether it's possible to complete the circular route by stopping at all the gas stations and filling up your tank. If it is possible, you should return the index of the starting gas station. Otherwise, you should return -1.

So how can we solve this problem? One idea is to start at the first gas station and keep driving around the circle, stopping at each gas station to fill up our tank. If we ever run out of gas, we know that it's not possible to complete the trip, so we can return -1.

But if we are able to complete the trip, how do we know which gas station to start at? One way is to try starting at each gas station and see if we can complete the trip from there. If we can, we return that gas station index as our answer.

Here's some Python code that solves the problem using this approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # If the total amount of gas is less than the total cost, it is not possible to complete the circuit
        if sum(gas) < sum(cost):
            return -1

        # Set the starting station to be the first station
        start = 0
        # Set the current amount of gas in our tank to be 0
        tank = 0
        # Iterate through each station
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            # Add the amount of gas we gain at this station to our tank, and subtract the cost of reaching the next station
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            # If we run out of gas, set the starting station to be the next station and reset the tank
            if tank < 0:
                start = i + 1
                tank = 0
        # Return the starting station if we were able to complete the circuit, or -1 if not
        return start
```

This solution has a **time complexity of O(N)**, since we only need to visit each gas station once. The **space complexity is O(1)**, since we only need to store a few variables regardless of the size of the input.

I hope this explanation was helpful, and that you now have a better understanding of how to solve the "Gas Station" problem!

Happy coding!
