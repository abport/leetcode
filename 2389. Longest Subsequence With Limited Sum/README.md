This is solution for the coding problem [2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum/description):

Imagine you have a bag with a bunch of different items in it, and each item has a number written on it. The problem is asking you to find the maximum number of items you can take out of the bag such that the sum of the numbers written on the items is less than or equal to a certain number. It gives you a list of these certain numbers, and you need to find the maximum number of items you can take out of the bag for each of these numbers.

The solution first sorts the numbers written on the items in the bag in ascending order. Then it creates a new list, called presum, where presum[i] is the sum of the first i+1 items in the sorted list.

For example, if the sorted list is [1, 2, 4, 5], then presum would be [1, 3, 7, 12].

Then, for each number in the list of certain numbers, the solution uses a helper function to find the maximum number of items we can take out of the bag. The helper function does this by using a technique called binary search to quickly find the largest number in presum that is less than or equal to the certain number.

For example, if the certain number is 10 and presum is [1, 3, 7, 12], then the helper function will return 2 because presum[2] is the largest number in presum that is less than or equal to 10.

The solution then adds 1 to the result from the helper function and adds it to the list of answers. This is because the helper function counts the number of items, but we need to count the size of the subsequence, which includes the number of items plus the empty spaces between them.

Finally, the solution returns the list of answers.

The time complexity of the solution is O(m log n), where m is the length of the queries array and n is the length of the nums array. This is because the solution performs a binary search m times, and each binary search takes O(log n) time.

The space complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the nums array. This is because the solution creates a new array called presum that has the same length as nums, and it also creates an array called res that has the same length as queries.

Note: The time complexity could also be written as O(m log m) because the length of queries is m, but it is generally more common to write the time complexity in terms of the size of the input that is being searched (in this case, the nums array).

```python
class Solution {
    // This function takes in an array of integers called 'nums' and an array of integers called 'queries'
    // It returns an array of integers called 'res'
    public int[] answerQueries(int[] nums, int[] queries) {
        // Sort the elements in 'nums' in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        // Find the length of 'nums' and store it in the variable 'len'
        int len = nums.length;
        // Create an array called 'presum' that has the same length as 'nums'
        int[] presum = new int[len];
        // Set the first element in 'presum' to be the first element in 'nums'
        presum[0] = nums[0];
        // Loop through the rest of the elements in 'nums'
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            // Set the ith element in 'presum' to be the sum of the previous element in 'presum' and the ith element in 'nums'
            presum[i] = presum[i - 1] + nums[i];
        }

        // Find the length of 'queries' and store it in the variable 'm'
        int m = queries.length;
        // Create an array called 'res' that has the same length as 'queries'
        int[] res = new int[m];
        // Loop through 'queries'
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            // Call the helper function and pass it 'presum' and the ith element in 'queries'
            // Store the result in the variable 'j'
            int j = helper(presum, queries[i]);
            // Set the ith element in 'res' to be 'j' plus 1
            res[i] = j + 1;
        }
        // Return 'res'
        return res;
    }

    // This function takes in an array of integers called 'nums' and an integer called 'target'
    // It returns an integer
    private int helper(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Set the left and right indices for the binary search to be the start and end of 'nums', respectively
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        // Initialize the result to be -1
        int res = -1;
        // Run the binary search until the left index is greater than the right index
        while (left <= right) {
            // Find the middle index between the left and right indices
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            // If the middle element in 'nums' is less than or equal to 'target'
            if (nums[mid] <= target) {
                // Update the result to be the middle index
                res = mid;
                // Set the left index to be one index to the right of the middle index
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Set the right index to be one index to the left of the middle index
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        // Return the result
        return res;
