This is a solution for the coding problem [394. Decode String from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/description):

Have you ever seen a message that looks like this: "3[a]2[bc]"? It might seem like a bunch of random letters and numbers at first, but it's actually a special way of encoding a message!

In this encoded message, the number before the square brackets (like "3" and "2" in this example) tells you how many times to repeat the letters inside the square brackets. For example, the encoded message "3[a]2[bc]" means:

- Repeat the letter "a" three times: "aaa"
- Repeat the letters "bc" two times: "bcbc"

So, if we put it all together, the encoded message "3[a]2[bc]" decodes to "aaabcbc".

But it's not always just one letter inside the square brackets. Sometimes there are more! For example, the encoded message "3[a2[c]]" means:

- Repeat the string "a2[c]" three times: "a2[c]a2[c]a2[c]"
- Then, decode the string "2[c]" to "cc": "accaccacc"

And if there are multiple encoded strings next to each other, we just decode them one at a time. For example, the encoded message "2[abc]3[cd]ef" means:

- Decode the string "2[abc]" to "abcabc"
- Decode the string "3[cd]" to "cdcdcd"
- Add the letters "ef" to the end: "abcabccdcdcdef"

So, how do we write a program to decode these encoded messages? One way is to use a stack. A stack is a special data structure that lets us add and remove items in a specific order.

We can loop through each character in the encoded message. If we see a "]", that means we need to decode the letters inside the square brackets. We can pop the characters from the stack one at a time until we reach the "[" character. These popped characters will be the letters we need to repeat.

Then, we can pop the "[" character from the stack. Next, we can keep popping characters from the stack until we reach a character that is not a digit. These popped characters will be the repetition count, which tells us how many times to repeat the letters. We can convert the repetition count to an integer and multiply the letters by that number.

Finally, we can append the repeated letters back to the stack. If we see any other character that is not "]", we can just add it to the stack.

After we have looped through all the characters in the encoded message, we can concatenate all the characters in the stack to get the decoded message.

Here's a example code and solution for the problem that shows how to decode an encoded message using a stack:

```python
def decodeString(s: str) -> str:
    # create an empty stack to keep track of the current repetition count and character group
    stack = []
    for c in s:
        if c == "]":
            # pop the character group from the stack
            group = ""
            # keep popping characters from the stack until we reach the "[" character
            while stack[-1] != "[":
                group = stack.pop() + group
            # pop the "[" character from the stack
            stack.pop()
            # pop the repetition count from the stack
            count = ""
            # keep popping characters from the stack until we reach a character that is not a digit
            while stack and stack[-1].isdigit():
                count = stack.pop() + count
            # convert the repetition count to an integer
            count = int(count)
            # add the repeated character group to the stack
            stack.append(group * count)
        else:
            # if the character is not "]", just add it to the stack
            stack.append(c)
    # concatenate all the characters in the stack and return the result
    return "".join(stack)

```

We can test the function with the examples from the prompt:

```python
print(decodeString("3[a]2[bc]"))  # should print "aaabcbc"
print(decodeString("3[a2[c]]"))  # should print "accaccacc"
print(decodeString("2[abc]3[cd]ef"))  # should print "abcabccdcdcdef"
```

#### Complexity Analysis

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the encoded message. This is because we loop through each character in the encoded message once. The space complexity is also O(n), because the maximum size of the stack will be equal to the length of the encoded message.

I hope this helps you understand how to decode these encoded messages!
