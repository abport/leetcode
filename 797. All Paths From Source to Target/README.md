This is a solution for the coding problem [797. All Paths From Source to Target from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/description):

A graph is a set of points (called "nodes") and lines (called "edges") that connect them. The edges show how the nodes are related. In this problem, we have a special kind of graph called a "directed acyclic graph" (DAG). This means that the edges only go in one direction (they don't go back), and it's not possible to get stuck in a loop (you can't visit the same node more than once).

We're given a graph with `n` nodes, labeled from `0` to `n-1`. We want to find all the possible paths from the first node (node `0`) to the last node (node `n-1`). We can do this by using a computer program that follows a specific process called "depth-first search".

Here's how the program works:

1.  It starts at the first node (node `0`).
2.  It looks at all the nodes it can reach from the current node (these are the nodes with an edge pointing to them).
3.  For each of those nodes, it does the following:
    1.  It adds the current node to a list of nodes that make up a path.
    2.  It repeats the process starting at the next node.
4.  If it reaches the last node (node `n-1`), it adds the path to a list of all paths.
5.  If it can't reach any more nodes, it goes back to the previous node and tries a different path.

The program will keep repeating this process until it has explored all possible paths. Then it will return the list of paths.

Here's an example of how the program might work on the graph `[[1, 2], [3], [3], []]`:

1.  It starts at node `0`.
2.  It can reach nodes `1` and `2`. It adds node `0` to the path and goes to node `1`.
3.  It can reach node `3`. It adds node `1` to the path and goes to node `3`.
4.  It can't reach any more nodes, so it adds the path `[0, 1, 3]` to the list of paths and goes back to node `1`.
5.  It goes back to node `0` and tries the other path (to node `2`).
6.  It can reach node `3`. It adds node `2` to the path and goes to node `3`.
7.  It can't reach any more nodes, so it adds the path `[0, 2, 3]` to the list of paths and goes back to node `0`.
8.  It can't reach any more nodes, so it stops and returns the list of paths `[[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3]]`.

The time complexity of this program is `O(2^n)`, which means that it will take longer to run as the number of nodes increases. This is because there are `2^n` possible paths in the graph (each node can either be included in the path or not). The space complexity is `O(n)`, which means that it will use more memory as the number of nodes increases. This is because the program stores the paths in a list as it finds them.
