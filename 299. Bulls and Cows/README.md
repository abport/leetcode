This is a solution for the coding problem [299. Bulls and Cows from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/description):

Imagine that you and your friend are playing a game where you each write down a secret number and then try to guess each other's numbers. To help your friend guess your number, you give them a hint that tells them how many digits they guessed correctly and how many of the digits they guessed are in your secret number, but in the wrong position.

To figure out how many digits your friend guessed correctly and how many of them are in your secret number, we can use two special dictionaries (also called "hashmaps") to keep track of the digits in your secret number and your friend's guess.

We start by going through each digit in your friend's guess, and checking if it is in the correct position (which we call a "bull"). If it is, we add one to the count of bulls. If it's not, we add one to the count of the digit in the dictionary for your friend's guess, and also add one to the count of the digit in the dictionary for your secret number.

After we've checked all the digits in your friend's guess, we can go through all the digits in the dictionary for your friend's guess and see if any of them are also in the dictionary for your secret number. If they are, we add the smaller of the two counts to the count of "cows" (which are the digits that are in your secret number but in the wrong position).

Finally, we put the counts of bulls and cows together in a special string format ("xAyB", where x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows) and return that as the hint for your friend's guess.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the secret or guess strings. This is because we iterate through the digits in the guess string once to compute the bulls and cows, and the hashmap operations (insertion and retrieval) take constant time.

The space complexity is also O(n), because we store the counts of the digits in the secret and guess strings in two separate hashmaps, which takes O(n) space.

Note that the space complexity can be improved to O(1) if we use a single hashmap to store the counts of the digits in both the secret and guess strings, rather than using two separate hashmaps. However, this would increase the time complexity slightly, since we would need to check if a key is present in the hashmap before incrementing its value.
