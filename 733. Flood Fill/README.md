This is a solution for the Coding Problem [733. Flood Fill from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/description):

The problem asks us to perform a flood fill on an image, starting from a specific pixel and replacing the color of all connected pixels of the same color as the starting pixel with a new color.

To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search algorithm to find all connected pixels of the same color as the starting pixel. We can use a queue to store the pixels that need to be colored, and a set to store the pixels that have been visited. This ensures that the search is efficient and avoids revisiting any pixels.

We can start by adding the starting pixel to the queue and marking it as visited. Then, we can repeatedly remove the first element from the queue and check if it has the same color as the starting pixel. If it does, we can color it with the new color and add its 4-connected neighbors (i.e. the pixels above, below, to the left, and to the right of it) to the queue. We can repeat this process until the queue is empty, at which point we will have colored all connected pixels of the same color as the starting pixel.

Finally, we can return the modified image. This will be the solution to the problem.
