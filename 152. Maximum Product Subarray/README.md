This is a solution for the coding problem [152.  Maximum Product Subarray from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description) in Python:


Have you ever heard of a subarray? A subarray is a part of an array. For example, if we have an array [1, 2, 3, 4], a subarray could be [2, 3].

Now, what if I told you we have to find the subarray with the highest product in it? Sounds like a fun problem, right?

The problem we are trying to solve is to find the maximum product of a subarray of a given list. To solve this problem, we can use a technique called dynamic programming.

First, let's think about what we need to keep track of. We need to know the maximum product ending at each index and the minimum product ending at each index. We also need to know the maximum product seen so far.

Now, let's go through the list one element at a time. For each element, we update the maximum and minimum product ending at that index by taking the maximum or minimum of the current element and the current element multiplied by the current maximum or minimum product.

We also check if the current element is negative. If it is, we swap the maximum and minimum product to ensure that the minimum product is used when multiplying with a negative number.

Finally, we update the maximum product seen so far as the maximum of the current maximum product seen so far and the current maximum product ending at the current index.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1) which means it will iterate through the input array once and it will use a constant amount of extra space.

Let's see an example with array [2,3,-2,4].

We start by initializing max_product = 2, min_product = 2 and max_so_far = 2

Iteration 1: max_product = max(3, 23) = 6, min_product = min(3, 23) = 3, max_so_far = max(2, 6) = 6

Iteration 2: max_product = max(-2, -26) = -2, min_product = min(-2, -26) = -12, max_so_far = max(6, -2) = 6

Iteration 3: max_product = max(4, -24) = 4, min_product = min(4, -24) = -8, max_so_far = max(6, 4) = 6

The final max_so_far is 6 which is the maximum product of subarray [3, -2, 4]

In conclusion, this problem might seem hard at first glance, but with the right approach, it can be solved easily. We used dynamic programming and we were able to keep track of the maximum and minimum product ending at each index, and update the maximum product seen so far. We also used a variable to check if the current element is negative, if so, we swapped the max_product and min_product variables to ensure that the minimum product is used when multiplying with a negative number.
