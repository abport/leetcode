This is a solution for the Coding Problem [542. 01 Matrix from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/description):

The time complexity of the breadth-first search solution is O(mn), because it processes each cell in the matrix once. This means that the running time of the algorithm is directly proportional to the size of the input matrix.

The space complexity of the breadth-first search solution is also O(mn), because it uses a 2D array to store the distances of each cell from the nearest 0. This means that the amount of memory used by the algorithm is also directly proportional to the size of the input matrix.

The time and space complexity of the depth-first search solution is also O(mn), because it also processes each cell in the matrix once and uses a 2D array to store the distances of each cell from the nearest 0.
