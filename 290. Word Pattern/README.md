This is a solution for the coding problem [290. Word Pattern from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern/description) in Python:

Today, we're going to solve a problem called "Word Pattern".

In this problem, we are given a pattern made up of characters and a string of words. Our task is to check if the pattern and the string of words follow the same pattern.

For example, let's say the pattern is "abc" and the string of words is "cat dog bat". The pattern and the string of words follow the same pattern because the first character in the pattern, "a", is mapped to the first word in the string, "cat", the second character in the pattern, "b", is mapped to the second word in the string, "dog", and the third character in the pattern, "c", is mapped to the third word in the string, "bat".

On the other hand, if the pattern is "abc" and the string of words is "cat dog cat", the pattern and the string of words do not follow the same pattern because the third character in the pattern, "c", is mapped to the second word in the string, "dog", which has already been mapped to the character "b".

To solve this problem, we can use a dictionary to store the mappings from characters in the pattern to words in the string, and a set to store the words that have already been mapped to a character in the pattern.

First, we split the string of words into a list of individual words. Then, we check if the number of characters in the pattern is not equal to the number of words in the string. If it is not, we return `False` because the pattern and the string of words do not have the same length and cannot follow the same pattern.

Next, we iterate through the characters in the pattern. For each character, we get the corresponding word at the current index in the list of words.

Then, we check if the character has already been mapped to a word. If it has, we check if the current word is the same as the mapped word. If it is not, we return `False` because the pattern and the string of words do not follow the same pattern.

If the character has not been mapped to a word, we check if the current word has already been mapped to a character in the pattern. If it has, we return `False` because the pattern and the string of words do not follow the same pattern.

If the character has not been mapped to a word and the current word has not been mapped to a character in the pattern, we map the character to the word and add the word to the set of mapped words.

Finally, if we have checked all the characters in the pattern and no issues were found, we return `True` because the pattern and the string of words follow the same pattern.

Here is the complete solution in Python:

```python
def wordPattern(pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
    # create a dictionary to store the mapping from characters
    # in the pattern to words in the string
    char_to_word = {}
    # create a set to store the words that have already been mapped
    # to a character in the pattern
    mapped_words = set()

    # split the string into a list of words
    words = s.split()

    # check if the number of characters in the pattern
    # is not equal to the number of words in the string
    if len(pattern) != len(words):
        return False

    # iterate through the characters in the pattern
    for i, char in enumerate(pattern):
        # get the word at the current index
        word = words[i]

        # check if the character has already been mapped to a word
        if char in char_to_word:
            # check if the word for the current character is not
            # the same as the current word
            if char_to_word[char] != word:
                return False
        else:
            # check if the current word has already been mapped
            # to a character in the pattern
            if word in mapped_words:
                return False
            # map the character to the word and add the word
            # to the set of mapped words
            char_to_word[char] = word
            mapped_words.add(word)

    # if no issues were found, return True
    return True
```

Now, let's analyze the time and space complexity of our solution.

The **time complexity** of our solution is **O(n)**, where n is the number of characters in the pattern. This is because we iterate through the characters in the pattern only once.

The **space complexity** of our solution is **O(n)**, where n is the number of characters in the pattern. This is because we create a dictionary and a set with a size of n to store the mappings and mapped words.

I hope you enjoyed solving this problem with me!
