Today we are going to solve a problem called "Minimum Rounds to Complete All Tasks". This problem is about counting how many times you need to perform a group of tasks in order to complete them all.

Let's say you have a list of tasks that you need to do. Some tasks can be done in just one round, but others take longer and need to be repeated multiple times. For example, you have the following tasks:

```python
[2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]
```

The first task takes 2 rounds to be completed, the second and third tasks take 3 rounds each, and the fourth and fifth tasks take 2 rounds each.

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. This means we will try to solve the tasks that take the most rounds first. This way, we can save time and complete the tasks as fast as possible.

Here is how our algorithm works:

1.  We start by creating a list with the remaining time for each task. This list will have the same length as the original list of tasks. For example, for the list above, the remaining time list would be: `[2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]`.
2.  We sort the remaining time list in decreasing order. This means that the tasks that take the most rounds will be at the beginning of the list.
3.  We loop through the sorted remaining time list and choose the first task with a remaining time greater than 0. We decrease the remaining time of this task by 1 and add the cost of the task (how many rounds it takes to be completed) to a variable called `round_number`.
4.  We repeat this process until all tasks are completed. When this happens, we return the `round_number` variable as the result.

Here is the final code in Python:

```python
def minimumRounds(tasks: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
    # Initialize the round number and the remaining time of each task
    round_number = 0
    remaining_time = tasks.copy()
    while True:
        # Sort the tasks by remaining time in decreasing order
        remaining_time = sorted(remaining_time, reverse=True)
        # Check if all tasks are completed
        if remaining_time[0] == 0:
            return round_number
        # Choose the task with the most remaining time
        for i, time in enumerate(remaining_time):
            if time > 0:
                remaining_time[i] -= 1
                round_number += cost[i]
                break
```

This solution has a **time complexity of O(n log n)**, because we need to sort the remaining time list at each iteration. The **space complexity is O(n)**, because we need to store the remaining time list and the cost list in memory.

I hope you enjoyed this problem and learned a little bit about greedy algorithms!
