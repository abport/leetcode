This is a solution for the coding problem [1046. Last Stone Weight from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/description?envType=study-plan&id=level-1):

In this article, we are going to learn about a fun problem that involves smashing stones together. Here is the problem:

You are given an array of integers called "stones" where "stones[i]" is the weight of the ith stone. We are going to play a game with these stones. In each turn, we will choose the heaviest two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights "x" and "y" with "x <= y". The result of this smash will be:

- If "x" is equal to "y", both stones will be destroyed.
- If "x" is not equal to "y", the stone with weight "x" will be destroyed, and the stone with weight "y" will have a new weight of "y - x".

At the end of the game, there will be at most one stone left. Your task is to write a function called "lastStoneWeight" that takes in an array of integers called "stones" and returns the weight of the last remaining stone. If there are no stones left, the function should return 0.

For example, if the input "stones" is [2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1], the function should return 1 because:

1.  We combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array becomes [2, 4, 1, 1, 1].
2.  We combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array becomes [2, 1, 1, 1].
3.  We combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array becomes [1, 1, 1].
4.  We combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array becomes [1].
5.  The weight of the last remaining stone is 1.

Let's try to solve this problem together!

One way to solve this problem is to use a data structure called a "heap". A heap is like a special kind of queue that always keeps the elements in a certain order. For this problem, we can use a "max heap" which is a heap that keeps the elements in decreasing order.

To implement a max heap, we can use the "heapq" module in Python. The "heapq" module provides functions to create and manipulate heaps. To create a max heap, we can first create a list of the stones and their weights, and then negate the weights. This is because the "heapq" module only provides functions for min heaps, but we want to create a max heap. By negating the weights, we can turn a min heap into a max heap.

For example, if the input "stones" is [2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1], we can create a max heap like this:

```python
import heapq

heap = [-2, -7, -4, -1, -8, -1]
heapq.heapify(heap)
```

The "heapify" function rearranges the elements in the list so that they form a heap. Now, the heap looks like this:

```python
[-8, -7, -4, -1, -2, -1]
```

Notice that the heaviest stone (which has weight 8) is at the top of the heap.

Now, we can start the game. In each turn, we will do the following steps:

1.  Extract the top two elements from the heap using the "heappop" function. This function removes and returns the smallest element from the heap. Since we negated the weights of the stones to create a max heap, the top two elements of the heap will be the heaviest stones.

2.  If the weights of the two stones are equal, we can simply remove both of them from the heap.
3.  If the weights are not equal, we can remove the heavier stone and decrease the weight of the lighter stone by the weight of the heavier stone. Then, we can insert the lighter stone back into the heap with its new weight using the "heappush" function.

We can keep doing this until the heap is empty or there is only one stone left in the heap. At the end, we can return the weight of the remaining stone (if there is one) or 0 (if the heap is empty).

Here is the complete Python code that implements this approach:

```python
import heapq

def lastStoneWeight(stones):
    # create a max heap
    heap = [-stone for stone in stones]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    # keep removing the heaviest two stones and combining them until
    # there is at most one stone left in the heap
    while len(heap) > 1:
        x = heapq.heappop(heap)
        y = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if x != y:
            # insert the lighter stone back into the heap with its new weight
            heapq.heappush(heap, x - y)

    # return the weight of the remaining stone (if there is one) or 0
    return -heap[0] if heap else 0

# test the function
stones = [2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1]
print(lastStoneWeight(stones)) # should print 1

stones = [1]
print(lastStoneWeight(stones)) # should print 1
```

Great job! Now you know how to solve the stone smashing problem using a heap.

#### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(n _ log n), where "n" is the number of stones. This is because we are using a heap, which has a time complexity of O(log n) for inserting and extracting elements. We perform these operations n times, so the overall time complexity is O(n _ log n).

#### Space Complexity:

The space complexity of this solution is O(n), where "n" is the number of stones. This is because we are using a heap to store the stones and their weights. The heap has a space complexity of O(n).

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
