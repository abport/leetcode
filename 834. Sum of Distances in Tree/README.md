This is a solution for the Coding Problem [834. Sum of Distances in Tree from LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-distances-in-tree/description):

The problem wanted us to find the sum of the distances between each node in a tree and all the other nodes in the tree.

To solve this problem, we can use a technique called depth-first search (DFS). DFS is a way of traversing all the nodes in a tree or graph by exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

We can use DFS in two steps:

1.  First, we perform a DFS starting from the root node (node 0) to calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node and the sum of distances between the subtree rooted at each node and the root node.
2.  Next, we perform a DFS starting from the root node again, but this time we use the results from the first DFS to calculate the sum of distances between each node and all the other nodes.

Let's go through the solution code line by line to understand how it works.

    from collections import defaultdict

This line imports a special kind of dictionary called a defaultdict from the Python module called `collections`. A defaultdict is a dictionary that has a default value for any keys that do not exist in the dictionary. We will use it to store the children of each node.

    children = defaultdict(list)

This line creates a defaultdict called `children` with a default value of an empty list.

    for u, v in edges:

This line starts a for loop that will iterate over each pair of nodes (u, v) in the `edges` list.

    children[u].append(v)

This line adds node v to the list of children of node u in the `children` defaultdict.

    children[v].append(u)

This line adds node u to the list of children of node v in the `children` defaultdict. This is necessary because the tree is undirected, so each node is connected to its neighbors by two edges (one in each direction).

    ans = [0] * n

This line creates a list called `ans` with n elements, each element being 0. This list will store the sum of distances between each node and all the other nodes.

    size = [1] * n

This line creates a list called `size` with n elements, each element being 1. This list will store the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node.

    def dfs(node, parent):

This line defines a function called `dfs` that takes two arguments: a node and its parent. The function will perform a DFS starting from the given node.

    for child in children[node]:

This line starts a for loop that will iterate over each child of the current node.

    if child != parent:

This line checks if the current child is not the parent of the current node. This is necessary to avoid counting the edge between the current node and its parent twice.

    dfs(child, node)

This line recursively calls the `dfs` function on the current child with the current node as its parent.

    size[node] += size[child]

This line adds the number of nodes in the child's subtree to the current node's subtree.

    ans[node] += ans[child] + size[child]

This line adds the sum of distances between the child's subtree and the current node to the answer array.

    def dfs2(node, parent):

This line defines a function called `dfs2` that takes two arguments: a node and its parent. The function will perform a DFS starting from the given node.

    for child in children[node]:

This line starts a for loop that will iterate over each child of the current node.

    if child != parent:

This line checks if the current child is not the parent of the current node. This is necessary to avoid counting the edge between the current node and its parent twice.

    ans[child] = ans[node] - size[child] + (n - size[child])

This line calculates the sum of distances between the current node and all the other nodes, and assigns it to the answer array at the index corresponding to the current child.

    dfs2(child, node)

This line recursively calls the `dfs2` function on the current child with the current node as its parent.

    dfs(0, None)

This line calls the `dfs` function on the root node (node 0) with no parent. This performs the first DFS to calculate the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node and the sum of distances between the subtree rooted at each node and the root node.

    dfs2(0, None)

This line calls the `dfs2` function on the root node (node 0) with no parent. This performs the second DFS to calculate the sum of distances between each node and all the other nodes.

    return ans

This line returns the `ans` list, which contains the sum of distances between each node and all the other nodes.
